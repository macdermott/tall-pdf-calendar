# Tall PDF Calendar

This is a Netlify Serverless function used to generate a PDF calendar for a given month and year.

## Usage

Browse to the following URL, replacing the month and year with the desired values:

```
https://tall-pdf-calendar.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/calendar?month=7&year=2023
```

This will generate a PDF calendar for July 2023. The PDF has been formatted to be printed on an A2 sheet of paper cut in half lengthways. That means the long sheet of paper will still fit in the printer.

Here is an screenshot of the generated PDF:
